is the adhan call to prayer the same at all 5 times during the day?

No, the actual wording and melody of the adhan are almost always identical for all five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha).
The only difference is a single extra phrase added only at the Fajr (dawn) call:
Standard line (in all five):
الصلاة خير من النوم
(as-salātu khayrun min an-nawm)
“Prayer is better than sleep”
This line is said twice, right after حي على الفلاح (hayya ‘ala l-falāh).
So:

Fajr adhan = normal adhan + 2× “Prayer is better than sleep”
The other four prayers = exactly the same text and usually the same melody/recording

In most neighborhoods/mosques that use a recording or the same muezzin, the audio file is 100 % identical for Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Only Fajr is slightly longer/different.
For your cancellation project that means:

One inverted WAV will perfectly cancel the four non-Fajr calls.
You need a second inverted WAV (of the Fajr version with the extra phrase) for dawn, or the script will only partially cancel it.
